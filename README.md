# Features

OpenBeken features:
- Tasmota-like setup, configuration and experience on all supported platforms (supports common Tasmota JSON over http and MQTT, etc)
- OTA firwmare upgrade system (for BK, W*00, BL602); to use OTA, drag and drop RBL file (always RBL file) on OTA field on new Web App Javascript Console
- MQTT compatibility with Home Assistant (with both Yaml generator and [HA Discovery](https://youtu.be/pkcspey25V4)) 
- Support for multiple relays, buttons, leds, inputs and PWMs, everything fully scriptable
- Driver system for custom peripherals, including [TuyaMCU](https://www.elektroda.com/rtvforum/topic3898502.html), I2C bus and [BL0942](https://www.elektroda.com/rtvforum/topic3887748.html), BL0937 power metering chips, Motor Driver Bridge.
- Supports multiple I2C devices, like TC74 temperature sensor, MCP23017 port expander, PCF8574T LCD 2x16 (or other?), etc
- NTP time from network (can be used with [TH06](https://www.elektroda.com/rtvforum/topic3942730.html) and other TuyaMCU devices), can run any script on selected weekday hour:minute:second
- basic support for [TuyaMCU Battery Powered devices protocol](https://www.elektroda.com/rtvforum/topic3914412.html) (TuyaMCU enables WiFi module only to report the state, eg. for door sensors, water sensors)
- RGBCW LED lighting control compatible with Home Assistant (both PWM LEDs, SM2135 LEDs and BP5758 LEDs)
- LittleFS integration for large files (resides in OTA memory, so you have to backup it every time you OTA)
- Command line system for starting and configuring drivers
- Short startup command (up to 512 characters) storage in flash config, so you can easily init your drivers (eg. BL0942) without LittleFS
- Advanced scripting and events system (allows you to mirror Tasmota rules, for example catch button click, double click, hold)
- Easily configurable via commands (see [tutorial](https://www.elektroda.com/rtvforum/topic3947241.html))
- Thanks to keeping Tasmota standard, OBK has basic compatibility with [ioBroker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4p3JHXbK1E&ab_channel=Elektrodacom) and similiar systems through TELE/STAT/CMND MQTT packets
- DDP lighting protocol support ("startDriver DDP" in autoexec.bat/short startup command), works with xLights
- Automatic reconnect when WiFi network goes out
- and much more

# Building

OpenBeken supports online builds for all platforms (BK7231T, BK7231N, XR809, BL602, W800), but if you want to compile it yourself, see  [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/openshwprojects/OpenBK7231T_App/blob/main/BUILDING.md)

# Flashing

See  [FLASHING.md](https://github.com/openshwprojects/OpenBK7231T_App/blob/main/FLASHING.md)
  
# Safe mode
  
  Device is counting full boots (full boot is a boot after which device worked for 30 seconds). If you power off and on device multiple times, it will enter open access point mode and safe mode (safe mode means even pin systems are not initialized). Those modes are used to recover devices from bad configs and errors.
    
# [Docs - Console Commands, Flags, Constants, Pin Roles, Channel Types, FAQ, autoexec.bat examples](https://github.com/openshwprojects/OpenBK7231T_App/blob/main/docs)
      
# Scripting engine
  
  Our scripting engine is able to process script files from LittleFS file system. Each script execution acts like a separate thread (but that's not a real RTOS thread, of course) and can process console commands, conditionals and delays.
  
  To create script, go to secondary web panel (JavaScript App), go to LittleFS tab, click "create file" and enter some content. Use buttons to stop all scripts or to save and run the one you are writing. From a console, you can also use 'startScript fileName label' syntax.
  
<br><b>Script example 1:</b><br>
Loop demo. Features a 'goto' script command (for use within script)
and, obviously, a label.<br>
Requirements: <br>
- channel 1 - output relay<br>

```
again:
	echo "Step 1"
	setChannel 1 0
	echo "Step 2"
	delay_s 2
	echo "Step 3"
	setChannel 1 1
	echo "Step 4"
	delay_s 2
	goto again
```

 <br><b>Script example 2:</b> <br>
Loop & if demo<br>
This example shows how you can use a dummy channel as a variable to create a loop<br>
Requirements: <br>
 - channel 1 - output relay<br>
 - channel 11 - loop variable counter<br>

```
restart:
	// Channel 11 is a counter variable and starts at 0
	setChannel 11 0
again:

	// If channel 11 value reached 10, go to done
	if $CH11>=10 then goto done
	// otherwise toggle channel 1, wait and loop
	toggleChannel 1
	addChannel 11 1
	delay_ms 250
	goto again
done:
	toggleChannel 1
	delay_s 1
	toggleChannel 1
	delay_s 1
	toggleChannel 1
	delay_s 1
	toggleChannel 1
	delay_s 1
	goto restart
``` 
  
 
 <br><b>Script example 3:</b> <br>
Thread cancelation demo and exclude self demo<br>
  This example shows how you can create a script thread with an unique ID and use this ID to cancel the thread later<br>
 Requirements: <br>
 - channel 1 - output relay<br>
 - pin 8 - button<br>
 - pin 9 - button<br>

```
// 'this' is a special keyword - it mean search for script/label in this file
// 123 and 456 are unique script thread names
addEventHandler OnClick 8 startScript this label1 123
addEventHandler OnClick 9 startScript this label2 456

label1:
	// stopScript ID bExcludeSelf
	// this will stop all other instances
	stopScript 456 1
	stopScript 123 1
	setChannel 1 0
	delay_s 1
	setChannel 1 1
	delay_s 1
	setChannel 1 0
	delay_s 1
	setChannel 1 1
	delay_s 1
	setChannel 1 0
	delay_s 1
	setChannel 1 1
	delay_s 1
	exit;
label2:
	// stopScript ID bExcludeSelf
	// this will stop all other instances
	stopScript 456 1
	stopScript 123 1
	setChannel 1 0
	delay_s 0.25
	setChannel 1 1
	delay_s 0.25
	setChannel 1 0
	delay_s 0.25
	setChannel 1 1
	delay_s 0.25
	setChannel 1 0
	delay_s 0.25
	setChannel 1 1
	delay_s 0.25
	setChannel 1 0
	delay_s 0.25
	exit;
```  

 
 <br><b>Script example 4:</b> <br>
Using channel value as a variable demo<br>
Requirements: <br>
- channel 1 - output relay<br>
- channel 11 - you may use it as ADC, or just use setChannel 11 100 or setChannel 11 500 in console to change delay<br>

```

// set default value
setChannel 11 500
// if you don't have ADC, use this to force-display 11 as a slider on GUI
setChannelType 11 dimmer1000

looper:
	setChannel 1 0
	delay_ms $CH11
	setChannel 1 1
	delay_ms $CH11
	goto looper
```  

# Simple TCP command server for scripting
  
  You can enable a simple TCP server in device Generic/Flags option, which will listen by default on port 100. Server can accept single connection at time from Putty in RAW mode (raw TCP connection) and accepts text commands for OpenBeken console. In future, we may add support for multiple connections at time. Server will close connection if client does nothing for some time.
  
  There are some extra short commands for TCP console:
- GetChannel [index] 
- GetReadings - returns voltage, current and power
- ShortName
the commands above return a single ASCII string as a reply so it's easy to parse.
  
# MQTT topics of published variables

Some MQTT variables are being published only at the startup, some are published periodically (if you enable "broadcast every minute" flag), some are published only when a given value is changed. Below is the table of used publish topics (TODO: add full descriptions)

Hint: in HA, you can use MQTT wildcard to listen to publishes. OBK_DEV_NAME/#

Publishes send by OBK device:
| Topic        | Sample Value  | Description  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -------------:|
| OBK_DEV_NAME/connected | "online" | Send on connect. |
| OBK_DEV_NAME/sockets |"5" | Send on connect and every minute (if enabled) |
| OBK_DEV_NAME/rssi |"-70" | Send on connect and every minute (if enabled) |
| OBK_DEV_NAME/uptime | "653" |Send on connect and every minute (if enabled) |

| OBK_DEV_NAME/host |"obk_t_fourRelays" | Send on connect and every minute (if enabled) |
| OBK_DEV_NAME/voltage/get |"221" | voltage from BL0942/BL0937 etc |
| OBK_DEV_NAME/led_enableAll/get | "1" |send when LED On/Off changes or when periodic broadcast is enabled |
| OBK_DEV_NAME/led_basecolor_rgb/get |"FFAABB" | send when LED color changes or when periodic broadcast is enabled.  |
| OBK_DEV_NAME/led_dimmer/get |"100" | send when LED dimmer changes or when periodic broadcast is enabled |
  
  
 Publishes received by OBK device:
 | Topic        | Sample Value  | Description  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -------------:|
| OBK_DEV_NAME/INDEX/set | "1" | Sets the channel of INDEX to given value. This can set relays and also provide DIRECT PWM access. If channel is mapped to TuyaMCU, TuyaMCU will also be updated |
| todo |"100" | tooodo |

# HomeAssistant Integration
MQTT based integration with Home Assistant is possible in 2 ways from the Home Assistant configuration page (`Config > Generate Home Assistant cfg`).

One can paste the generated [yaml](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/yaml/) configuration into Home Assistant configuration manually.

Or add the devices automatically via discovery. To do click the `Start Home Assistant Discovery` button which sends outs [MQTT discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/) messages, one for each entity (switch, light).
* The discovery topic should match the `discovery_prefix` defined in Home Assistant, the default value is `homeassistant`.
* More details about Home Assistant discovery can be found [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/).

Note: Currently, discovery is only implemented for light and relay entities.
