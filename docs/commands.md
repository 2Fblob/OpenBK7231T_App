# Commands
Here is the latest, up to date command list.
This file was autogenerated by running 'node scripts/getcommands.js' in the repository.
All descriptions were taken from code.
Do not add anything here, as it will overwritten with next rebuild.
| Command        | Arguments          | Description  |
|:------------- |:------------- | -----:|
| SetChannel | [ChannelIndex][ChannelValue] | Sets a raw channel to given value. Relay channels are using 1 and 0 values. PWM channels are within [0,100] range. Do not use this for LED control, because there is a better and more advanced LED driver with dimming and configuration memory (remembers setting after on/off), LED driver commands has 'led_' prefix. |
| ToggleChannel |  | qqqqq0 |
| AddChannel | [ChannelIndex][ValueToAdd][ClampMin][ClampMax] | Adds a given value to the channel. Can be used to change PWM brightness. Clamp min and max arguments are optional. |
| ClampChannel |  | qqqqq0 |
| SetPinRole | [PinRole][RoleIndexOrName] | This allows you to set a pin role, for example a Relay role, or Button, etc. Usually it's easier to do this through WWW panel, so you don't have to use this command. |
| SetPinChannel | [PinRole][ChannelIndex] | This allows you to set a channel linked to pin from console. Usually it's easier to do this through WWW panel, so you don't have to use this command. |
