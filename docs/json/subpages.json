		"content": "Device is counting full boots (full boot is a boot after which device worked for 30 seconds). If you power off and on device multiple times, it will enter open access point mode and safe mode (safe mode means even pin systems are not initialized). Those modes are used to recover devices from bad configs and errors."

		"content": "  You can enable a simple TCP server in device Generic/Flags option, which will listen by default on port 100. Server can accept single connection at time from Putty in RAW mode (raw TCP connection) and accepts text commands for OpenBeken console. In future, we may add support for multiple connections at time. Server will close connection if client does nothing for some time.\n\n  There are some extra short commands for TCP console:\n- GetChannel [index] \n- GetReadings - returns voltage, current and power\n- ShortName \nthe commands above return a single ASCII string as a reply so it's easy to parse."

You can also improve this YAML, edit it however you like, because for some advanced devices the autogenerated config might be empty\nOr add the devices automatically via discovery (see [YT tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkcspey25V4). To do click the `Start Home Assistant Discovery` button which sends outs [MQTT discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/) messages, one for each entity (switch, light).\n* The discovery topic should match the `discovery_prefix` defined in Home Assistant, the default value is `homeassistant`.\n* More details about Home Assistant discovery can be found [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/).\n Note: Currently, discovery is implemented for lights, relays, and simple sensor entities.
